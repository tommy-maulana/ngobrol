# Ngobrol

Ngobrol is an Open Source alternative to Clubhouse, Twitter Spaces and similar audio spaces.

With Ngobrol you can create `Obrolan` which are audio rooms that can be used for panel discussions, Ngobrol sessions, free flowing conversations, debates, theatre plays, musicals and more. The only limit is your imagination.
