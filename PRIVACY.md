Privacy Considerations for Jam
==============================

No Analytics
------------

Jam does not use any analytics provider and we does not store IP addresses in the logs.

What is stored on the backend and why
-------------------------------------

### For participants

- The name people give themselves (if they do). This is so you don't have to set your name in each new room on one instance
- The email address people add (if they do). This is used to display the gravatar for that email address. 
None of this data is mandatory though.

### For rooms

- The room name, description and url. This is to allow people who join to query it
- The list of speakers and mods. This is to make it possible to leave a room and come back and still keep your role.


Conversation privacy
--------------------

- Everyone who knows the room url can listen to the conversation
- So can the administrator of the instance as all room urls are stored on the backend
- Any consideration regarding WebRTC ip adress leaks apply

Metadata privacy
----------------

- In a room every participant has access to the names and email addresses the other participants set for themselves

Planned Improvements
--------------------

- We plan to only store MD5 hashes instead of email addresses
- We plan to move away from Gravatar to our own set of random Avatars

Other ideas
-----------

- Allow moderators to delete the room data when it is not needed anymore (Important disallow recreation of room with the same id to avoid room impersonation)

Self Hosting
------------

Most eventual privacy concerns can be addressed by hosting your own instance and only giving the link of your room to trusted individuals.
